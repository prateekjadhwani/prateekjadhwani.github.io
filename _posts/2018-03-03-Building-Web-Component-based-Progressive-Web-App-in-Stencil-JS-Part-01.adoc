= Building WebComponent based Progressive WebApp in Stencil JS - Part 01

Stencil.js is a compiler for WebComponents. It lets you write Web Components in TypeScript and jsx. If you are new to Stencil.js please take a look at their site link:https://stenciljs.com/[https://stenciljs.com] for a brief introduction.

You can download the link:https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-app-starter[starter project] by simply cloning it so that you can skip the configuration part which may take ages.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-app-starter my-pwa 
```

You can then install the dependencies by using the following the command inside the `my-pwa` folder

```shell
npm install
```

== Hello World

Let's take a look at a Hello World Example. Create a file `hello-world.tsx` inside the `my-pwa/src/components/hello-world/` folder.

```js
import { Component } from '@stencil/core';

@Component({
    tag: 'hello-world',
    styleUrl: 'hello-world.css'
})
export class HelloWorld {
    render() {
        return (
            <h1>Hello World</h1>
        );
    }
}
``` 

The part `@Component` is a decorator which gives you information about the 

As you can see that we are also trying to use a css file called `hello-world.css`. Let's first create this file inside the same `hello-world` folder.

```css
hello-world h1 {
    color: red;
}
```

Now, in order to see this component on to the page, we need to use it first. Let's add the component `<hello-world>` in the `<app-home>` component.

In file `app-home.tsx` inside the ` my-pwa/src/components/app-home/` folder we will simply add the `hello-world` component.

Before: 
```js

   <button>
     Profile page
```

Once this is done, we can now use the npm command to start the server and launch the page on to the browser with our hello world component.

```shell
npm run dev
```

The output looks like this

== Upcoming in Part 02

This blog just gives you a basic introduction on Stencil.js and how we can use the biolerplate template to have our own `hello-world` component in a PWA. In the next blog in this series, we will be looking at link:https://dribbble.com/shots/2359374-Mail-client-app[Mail Client App by Jakub Antalik] (refer screenshot below) and how we can create it in our demo.
