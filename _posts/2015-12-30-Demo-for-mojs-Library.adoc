== What is mo.js Library
I like to call mo.js a motion/animation library since I have only seen its use in creating animations or motion based UI. More details about the library can be found at link:http://mojs.io/[mo.js Website].

== How to use this library (tl;dr version)
This library is pretty simple to use.

For example: to use the link:http://mojs.io/tutorials/easing/path-easing/[Path Easing] functionality, you just need to provide the following details:

* A path easing graph, usually in the form of a svg
* Animation time
* Property change code for a DOM element.

Ofcourse this is the tl;dr version, so I am omitting a lot of optional parameters, but if you want you can look for more details link:http://mojs.io/tutorials/easing/path-easing/[here].
