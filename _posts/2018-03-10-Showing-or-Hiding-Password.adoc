Got bored while my PS4 was installing Monster Hunter World. And ended up making this concept link:https://dribbble.com/shots/4298963-Show-password[Show Password] by link:https://dribbble.com/prekesh[Prekesh]

=== Dribbble UI

This is what the UI looks like.

If only, the browsers had an attribute in `input[type=password]` to show and hide passwords.
