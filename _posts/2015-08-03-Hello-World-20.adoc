= Hello World 2.0

You guys must be wondering what happened to my old site. Well, I got tired of all the maintainence work that I had to do every now and then. And all the money that I was spending on just a 100MB space. Plus, this way I can concentrate more on what I love to do, i.e. code.

I am pretty sure I won't be importing any of the posts from by old blog site. Sorry about that :( 

It's a lot of effort for old technologies which I am never planning to use!! Although I will try to import some good ones.

In either case, I will try to keep you guys posted on the stuff that I have been doing or planning to do in the coming days.
