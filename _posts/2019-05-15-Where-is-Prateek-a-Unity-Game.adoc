I know I have been missing in action and haven't written anything at all in a  really long time. And I will be honest... I gave up on the blog. In the past 10 years of me writing blogs, there have been times when I totally stop writing the blogs for a few months and then start writing again. And the last time this happened was when I moved my blog from Wordpress to Hubpress on Github.

But the good news is I am back. And here are the updates.

## Unity 3D

First and foremost news, I started learning Unity last year. And here is my first attempt to this technology:

### 1. Recycle Recycle

I created this game as a test project to see what can be done with Unity and basic / newbie Pixel art. The game is released on iOS and can be found link:https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/recycle-recycle/id1431570689?mt=8[here].

### 2. Chopper To Hell

This is another interesting unity 3d project. My aim was to create a game using the asset store with $0 budget. The game involved killing spiders while controlling a chopper. This game needs its own blog, so I will try to write a totally new blog on it in the coming days, especially about the lessons learned.

The game was released on Steam and can be found  link:https://store.steampowered.com/app/1061790/Chopper_To_Hell/[here].

## Pixel Art

I have also been trying to play around with pixel art. I still have problems with Walk Cycles, but I am getting better at creating random artwork.

## Writing a book

In the past few months, I have also been writing a book. While I am trying to learn Unity3d, I am also keeping up with learning frontend technologies and keeping up with the market. And I know, I haven't been writing blogs, but I am spending that energy on to writing a book. 

I cannot say anything more about it. XD

# Summary

There you go guys, all the updates. I will try not to disappear again for a long time.
